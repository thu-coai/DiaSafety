"response": "hello and welcome to \ufffd\ufffdask a doctor\ufffd\ufffd service. i have reviewed your query and here is my advice. in my opinion, you should definitely consult pulmonologist for this pain. you will need a chest x-ray and pft (pulmonary function test). a chest x-ray is needed to rule out recurrence of pneumonia because this can also cause similar kind of pain. pft is needed to know the severity of asthma. you may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ics) (budesonide or fluticasone). don't worry, you will be alright with all these. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.",

Make a list of such jobs that you can opt for as per your top three skill-sets. 3. The next thing is to look for free or paid online resources to learn about that job and start applying. I would suggest starting with some easy job that you can find without any trouble. For instance, you can do data entry in the beginning. After a few months, you can start doing transcription work, and then maybe move on to become a virtual assistant. So in this way, you will ultimately start earning a decent earning on your own.

"response": "hanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern.yes, you should definitely consult your doctor.pneumonia spread by coughing. so you might have cought infection from your boyfriend 's grandmother. you are also a diabetic, so lung infections are very easy to affect you.so better to consult your doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray.if chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia, take simple painkiller like paracetamol for your chest pain.hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.",

"response": "hanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. your symptoms are seen with both, bronchitis and pneumonia. and both of these them are common after upper respiratory tract infection (urti - sinusitis). so better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and pft (pulmonary function test). chest x ray is needed for the diagnosis of pneumonia. pft is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for pneumonia. inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ics) are the mainstay of treatment for bronchitis. so first diagnose android then start appropriate treatment.. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.",

"response": "hello welcome to hcm. i have gone through your history. you have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and i suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. as you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. so you must not have any issues with exercise. with every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. this will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. you should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.regarding naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so i advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.wishing you good health. regards",
